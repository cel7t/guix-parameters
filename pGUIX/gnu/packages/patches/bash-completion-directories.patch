Bash-completion is written with FHS in mind where completion scripts
all get added to /usr/share/bash-completion/completions and are picked
up by the dynamic completion loader from there---whether they are
part of bash-completion or installed by another package.

On Guix systems, we want not only to search within bash-completion's own
directory, but also in the user's profile and guix home profile, as well
as in the system profile.
This is what this patch does.
