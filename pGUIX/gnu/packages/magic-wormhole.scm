wormhole, which makes it possible to securely transfer arbitrary-sized files and
directories (or short pieces of text) from one computer to another.  The two
endpoints are identified by using identical \"wormhole codes\": in general, the
sending machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into
the receiving machine.

The codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct
wordlist.  The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so usually
only a few characters must be typed.  Wormhole codes are single-use and do not
need to be memorized.")
