    (description
     "In 2002, Sam Williams wrote Free as in Freedom, a biography of Richard
M. Stallman.  In its epilogue, Williams expressed hope that choosing to
distribute his book under the GNU Free Documentation License would enable and
encourage others to share corrections and their own perspectives through
modifications to his work.  Free as in Freedom (2.0) is Stallman's revision of
the original biography.  While preserving Williams's viewpoint, it includes
factual corrections and extensive new commentary by Stallman, as well as new
prefaces by both authors written for the occasion.  It is a rare kind of
biography, where the reader has the benefit of both the biographer's original
words and the subject's response.")
