;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This is the build-side support code of (guix bzr-download).  It allows a
;;; Bazaar repository to be branched at a specific revision.
;;;
;;; Code:

(define* (bzr-fetch url revision directory
                    #:key (bzr-command "brz"))
  "Fetch REVISION from URL into DIRECTORY.  REVISION must be a valid Bazaar
revision identifier.  Return #t on success, else throw an exception."
  ;; Do not attempt to write .bzr.log to $HOME, which doesn't exist.
  (setenv "BZR_LOG" "/dev/null")
  ;; Disable SSL certificate verification; we rely on the hash instead.
  (invoke bzr-command "-Ossl.cert_reqs=none" "checkout"
          "--lightweight" "-r" revision url directory)
  (with-directory-excursion directory
    (delete-file-recursively ".bzr")))
