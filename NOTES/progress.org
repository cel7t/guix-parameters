#+TITLE:Progress Log
* -1/-1
** Created this repository
** Initial blog entry on parameterized packages and progress.org, todo.org and wishlist.org
** Applied Ludo's patch to a recent version of the code
The patch was failing so I had to manually apply it.
** Added draft parameter parsers to DRAFTS
* 6/4
** GUIX repository got deleted while trying to commit, re-applied the patch and made a backup
** s/enabled/on/g s/disabled/off/g
** Created p/os-parameters and p/os-parameters-overriding!
** Added a parameters section to OS record, needs some more work
** Added required-off for packages with hard parameter disagreements
Example: an x86 package that absolutely cannot run on ARM
This feature will mostly be used for signaling errors
* 6/5
** Made a side-effect free version of p/os-parameters-overriding!
