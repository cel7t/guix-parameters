GNU Guix consists of Scheme code that implements the deployment model
of the Nix package management tool.  In fact, it currently talks to a
build daemon whose code comes from Nix (see the manual for details.)

Nix was initially written by Eelco Dolstra; other people have been
contributing to it.  See `nix/AUTHORS' for details.

The list of GNU Guix contributors is now generated from the output of
'git log' and written to this file, as can be seen in release tarballs.
