;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This module supports "grafts".  Grafting a directory means rewriting it,
;;; with references to some specific items replaced by references to other
;;; store items---the grafts.
;;;
;;; This method is used to provide fast security updates as only the leaves of
;;; the dependency graph need to be grafted, even when the security updates
;;; affect a core component such as Bash or libc.  It is based on the idea of
;;; 'replace-dependency' implemented by Shea Levy in Nixpkgs.

  ;; whose hash is in REPLACEMENT-TABLE, we perform the required rewrite and

  ;;
  ;; To support UTF-16 and UTF-32 store references, the 33 bytes comprising
  ;; this hash+dash pattern may optionally be interspersed by extra NUL bytes.
  ;; This simple approach works because the characters we are looking for are
  ;; restricted to ASCII.  UTF-16 hashes are interspersed with single NUL
  ;; bytes ("\0"), and UTF-32 hashes are interspersed with triplets of NULs
  ;; ("\0\0\0").  Note that we require NULs to be present only *between* the
  ;; other bytes, and not at either end, in order to be insensitive to byte
  ;; order.

  ;; To accommodate large files, we do not read the entire file at once, but

  ;; every hash+dash pattern appears in its entirety in at least one buffer,
  ;; adjacent buffers must overlap by one byte less than the maximum size of a
