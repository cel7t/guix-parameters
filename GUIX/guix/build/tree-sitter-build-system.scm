;; Commentary:
;;
;; Build procedures for tree-sitter grammar packages.  This is the
;; builder-side code, which builds on top of the node build-system.
;;
;; Tree-sitter grammars are written in JavaScript and compiled to a native
;; shared object.  The `tree-sitter generate' command invokes `node' in order
;; to evaluate the grammar.js into a grammar.json file, which is then
;; translated into C code.  We then compile the C code ourselves.  Packages
;; also sometimes add extra manually written C/C++ code.
;;
;; In order to support grammars depending on each other, such as C and C++,
;; JavaScript and TypeScript, this build-system installs the source of the
;; node module in a dedicated "js" output.
;;
;; Code:
