(define* (make-grub-efi-netboot-installer grub-efi grub-cfg subdir)
  "Make a bootloader-installer for a grub-efi-netboot bootloader, which expects
its files in SUBDIR and its configuration file in GRUB-CFG.

As a grub-efi-netboot package is already pre-installed by 'grub-mknetdir', the
installer basically copies all files from the bootloader-package (or profile)
into the bootloader-target directory.

Additionally for network booting over TFTP, two relative symlinks to the store
and to the GRUB-CFG file are necessary.  Due to this a TFTP root directory must
not be located on a FAT file-system.

If the bootloader-target does not support symlinks, then it is assumed to be a
kind of EFI System Partition (ESP).  In this case an intermediate configuration
file is created with the help of GRUB-EFI to load the GRUB-CFG.

The installer is usable for any efi-bootloader-chain, which prepares the
bootloader-profile in a way ready for copying.

The installer does not manipulate the system's 'UEFI Boot Manager'.

The returned installer accepts the BOOTLOADER, TARGET and MOUNT-POINT
arguments.  Its job is to copy the BOOTLOADER, which must be a pre-installed
grub-efi-netboot package with a SUBDIR like efi/boot or efi/Guix, below the
directory TARGET for the system whose root is mounted at MOUNT-POINT.

MOUNT-POINT is the last argument in 'guix system init /etc/config.scm mnt/point'
or '/' for other 'guix system' commands.

Where TARGET comes from the targets argument given to the
bootloader-configuration in:

(operating-system
 (bootloader (bootloader-configuration
              (targets '(\"/boot/efi\"))
              …))
 …)

TARGET is required to be an absolute directory name, usually mounted via NFS,
and finally needs to be provided by a TFTP server as
the TFTP root directory.

Usually the installer will be used to prepare network booting over TFTP.  Then
GRUB will load tftp://server/SUBDIR/grub.cfg and this file will instruct it to
load more files from the store like tftp://server/gnu/store/…-linux…/Image.

To make this possible two symlinks are created.  The first symlink points
relatively form MOUNT-POINT/TARGET/SUBDIR/grub.cfg to
MOUNT-POINT/boot/grub/grub.cfg, and the second symlink points relatively from
MOUNT-POINT/TARGET/%store-prefix to MOUNT-POINT/%store-prefix.

It is important to note that these symlinks need to be relative, as the absolute
paths on the TFTP server side are unknown.

It is also important to note that both symlinks will point outside the TFTP root
directory and that the TARGET/%store-prefix symlink makes the whole store
accessible via TFTP.  Possibly the TFTP server must be configured to allow
accesses outside its TFTP root directory.  This all may need to be considered
for security aspects.  It is advised to disable any TFTP write access!

The installer can also be used to prepare booting from local storage, if the
underlying file-system, like FAT on an EFI System Partition (ESP), does not
support symlinks.  In this case the MOUNT-POINT/TARGET/SUBDIR/grub.cfg will be
created with the help of GRUB-EFI to load the /boot/grub/grub.cfg file.  A
symlink to the store is not needed in this case."
